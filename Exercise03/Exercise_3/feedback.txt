 nice exercise, took me again a lot of days.
 I had some confusion which clock cycle to use (1 vs 16 )?? Was this in the last exercise changed
 to have an easyer debugging with the logic analyzer ?
 
 I read to late that x and y are flipped. I have configured the library according to the
 picture on the board (sorry, i didnt had time to change that).
 
 I still didnt really got what the selftest ist good for, sould it just proove that the sensor works? Meaning
 there is a deviation from the values when the test force is applied ?
